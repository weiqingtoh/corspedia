What is the role of randomization in the design of scientific experiments\r\n(for instance, why are patients randomly assigned to treatments in a\r\nmedical trial)? We recreate a famous incident in which a tea time\r\nconversation led to a statistician conducting an experiment to test\r\nwhether someone could distinguish whether milk had been added first\r\nor last to a cup of tea.\r\n\r\n3. How has statistical thinking been used and abused in the history of IQ\r\ntesting?\r\n\r\n4. In the analysis of environmental problems like global warming scientific\r\nmodels are often used which are deterministic (roughly speaking, such\r\nmodels predict a definite output for a given input). A statistical model on\r\nthe other hand gives predictions in the form of probabilities of different\r\npossible outcomes. How can the deep physical understanding\r\nembedded in the deterministic models be reconciled with statistical\r\napproaches to quantifying uncertainty and risk, and why is quantifying\r\nuncertainty important?\r\n\r\n5. How can fake random numbers generated on a computer by non-random\r\nrules sometimes do complicated calculations that aren\u2019t easily done by\r\nother means?\r\n\r\n6.

The function depends on the activity, which in turn is governed by the design and structure. Chemical synthesis is generally guided by good structural design.

In this course the term \u2018redesign\u2019 includes \u2018reengineering\u2019. All systems are designed and developed to support business processes. Therefore, an understanding of the business processes is crucial to choosing how to build and manage systems, re-skill personnel and retool the infrastructure. A business process is a collection of activities that creates an output that is of value to some customer. Business processes can be improved at any level of an organization or can be improved across multiple organizations. Typically, Business Process Redesign/Reengineering (BPR) uses information technology to enable business process change in order to reduce costs, improve service, and reduce cycle times. Several BPR methodologies exist. Most methodologies require the construction of an \u201cAs-Is\u201d and \u201cTo-Be\u201d model. This course will discuss the role of BPR in managing technology and the operational functions. The course will cover the strategic, operational and technological dimensions of BPR in the context of quality improvement, Information Technology and business operations.

No longer is human influence on the planet confined to the local environment, but now extends across political boundaries - often resulting in regional or even global impacts. As a result, society, industry and agriculture are under increasing pressure to improve environmental performance and cut resource consumption and pollution. Around the world, governments are striving to minimise waste production, protect water resources, reduce energy consumption and improve the quality of the urban living environment. As the human global population grows exponentially and the life-support systems of the planet continue to deteriorate, there is a growing international recognition that environmental problems require truly global solutions. This course will focus on the issues and causes of global environmental issues including: population growth, resource exploitation and threats to the atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere.

There are two components to the course, lectures and seminars. Lectures will present the theoretical concepts and models of thought regarding urban design. Seminars focus on the discussion and interrogation of influential writings and case studies of urban projects, and present opportunities for students to interpret and debate the relevance and applications of these modes of thinking and acting on the built environment.", "title": "Theory and Elements of Urban Design", "preclusion": "Nil", "module": "UD5221", "credit": "4", "prerequisite": "Nil"}, "PC1143": {"description": "This module covers the fundamentals of electricity and magnetism: electric fields, electric flux and Gauss's law, electric potential; capacitance, dielectrics, current and resistance; DC circuits; magnetic fields, magnetic effect of currents, Ampere's law, electromagnetic induction; AC circuits; magnetism in matter; electromagnetic waves.

It is designed to equip students with the standard tools and techniques to analyze microeconomic issues and to prepare them to access higher level modules that utilize microeconomic analysis. \n\n\n\nThe module begins with a review of several foundation topics on consumer and producer theory covered in the prerequisite course, i.e. EC2101.  It then moves on to discuss the general equilibrium model, whereby consumers and producers are put together in a general equilibrium framework.  After that, it covers choice over time, i.e. inter-temporal choice and choices over different states of the world, i.e. choices under uncertainty. It then continues with game theory. This topic will be discussed extensively. Coverage will include various solution concepts for one-shot games and sequential move games.  Applications of the theory on the issues of oligopolistic competition, entry and entry prevention, and network economics will receive a great deal of attention. Finally, the module ends with the asymmetric information, i.e. moral hazard and adverse selection and its application on the internal organisation of the firm.
