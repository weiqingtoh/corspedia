The function depends on the activity, which in turn is governed by the design and structure. Chemical synthesis is generally guided by good structural design.

It is often directed with negative effect towards figures and structures of authority, and is sometimes an integral part of a world-view. Students will engage closely with a variety of texts of different types, including poems, tracts, short stories, speeches, plays, sketches, songs and pictures. In doing so, they will reach a better understanding of the roles irony can play not only in literature, but also in society more generally.

It is well recognized by the world\u2019s scientific, industrial and political communities that the atmospheric concentration of CO2 has been steadily increasing due to human activities and economic development, which accelerates the greenhouse effect. In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) mandated a reduction of CO2 emission levels to below those of 1990. To reduce the CO2 emission and maintain a desired balance in atmosphere, new technologies have been developed. CO2 capture and storage is one of the approaches. It is also possible to convert CO2 to some reusable hydrocarbons or chemicals through physical, chemical and biological processes. The most important challenge is how to activate CO2 economically as it has high thermodynamic stability. Solar energy should be one of the best candidates because it is totally clean and abundant. Consequently, the highly efficient and selective photochemical reduction systems for CO2 are highly desired.

Last, but not least, the course demonstrates the role of bioinformaticians as a bridge between the field of computer science and biology, and prepares students for advanced computer-science topics relevant to bioinformatics.", "title": "Introduction to Computational Biology", "preclusion": "Nil", "module": "CS2220", "credit": "4", "prerequisite": "CS1102 or CS1102C or CS1102S.

We review consumption and investment theories, and study the determinants of money demand and supply.  Aggregate Supply functions under differing assumptions regarding labour-market clearing and price expectations (rational or adaptive) are derived next, and combined with the Aggregate Demand function to study policy and other effects.  We next examine the expectations-augmented Phillips Curve, and simple inflation-unemployment dynamics.  We also study further policy issues (time inconsistency, Ricardian Equivalence, profit-sharing), open-economy macroeconomics (the Mundell-Fleming model), and simple growth theory (the Solow model and the AK endogenous growth model).", "title": "Macroeconomic Analysis II", "preclusion": "EC2122, EC3201, EC3152", "module": "EC3102", "credit": "4", "prerequisite": "EC2102/EC2152 and EC2101/EC2151"}, "EC3101": {"description": "This module is a continuation of the foundation module on microeconomics.  It is designed to equip students with the standard tools and techniques to analyze microeconomic issues and to prepare them to access higher level modules that utilize microeconomic analysis. \n\n\n\nThe module begins with a review of several foundation topics on consumer and producer theory covered in the prerequisite course, i.e. EC2101.  It then moves on to discuss the general equilibrium model, whereby consumers and producers are put together in a general equilibrium framework.  After that, it covers choice over time, i.e. inter-temporal choice and choices over different states of the world, i.e. choices under uncertainty. It then continues with game theory. This topic will be discussed extensively. Coverage will include various solution concepts for one-shot games and sequential move games.  Applications of the theory on the issues of oligopolistic competition, entry and entry prevention, and network economics will receive a great deal of attention. Finally, the module ends with the asymmetric information, i.e. moral hazard and adverse selection and its application on the internal organisation of the firm. Throughout the course, empirical observations and real-life cases pertaining to the issues discussed in this module are presented.  \n\n", "title": "Microeconomic Analysis II", "preclusion": "EC2121, EC3201, EC3151", "module": "EC3101", "credit": "4", "prerequisite": "EC2101/EC2151"}, "PS3880C": {"credit": "4", "description": "The Enlightenment of the 18th century is commonly seen as the origin of \u2018modernity\u2019.
